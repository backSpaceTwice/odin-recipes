          with your favorite toppings. Here is a simple recipe to make fluffy
          pancakes at home.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
            salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and
            vanilla extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until
            just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease
            it with butter or cooking spray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until
            bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3
            minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fresh fruit,
            or whipped cream.
          </li>
        </ol>
