      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned.
        Add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the marinara
        sauce and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

        In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, dried basil, and a pinch of
        salt.

        In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer
        with 3 lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, a
        layer of meat sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the
        layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat
        sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the
        top.
